Gemastik demo apps for BUJANG team

This is not a big project, this one is made for GEMASTIK 10 Competition in 2017, and this isn't a whole full android apps, this is just a demo apps.
So, we just focus on the interfaces, we don't put any logic here yet.
BUt probably it could be help for any developer
